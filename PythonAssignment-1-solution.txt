## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
A1. We call python as high-level programming language beacuse we can interact with it in a defined language not as 0 or 1 only
 
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
A4. We can use it in any domain but it prominently used in data engineering, data science, ML etc

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
A5. Variables are boxes which have address of the storage location. We can assign it value which we can also change afterwards i.e. it is not constant.
    We can declare them like this:
	x= 5
	num = 100
	num_list = [1,2,3,4]
	empty_list = []

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
A6. Using the input() function

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
A7. Its string

Q8. What is type casting?
A8. Using typecasting we can change the datatype of the variable or value. e.g. str(5) will change the value of 5 from int to string.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
A9. Yes we can take more than one input from single input() function. We can achieve this using split.
    e.g. suppose we have 1,2,3,4,5 as input then we can use 
	num1,num2,num3,num4,num5 = int(input().split(,)) this to take all the values in one go.

Q10. What are keywords?
A10. keywords are predefined words which already has an existing meaning in python and they cannot be used as variable name, function name etc.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
A11. No we can't use keywords as a variable name as it has already predefined meaning/value. 

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
A12. Indentation refers to space before each line. In Python indentation has functional important unlike other language, it represents a particular block of code.
     e.g. 
     num = 75
     if num > 50:
	print('Pass')
     else:
	print('fail')
     Here indentation after if condition and else condition represents that print('Pass') and print('fail') statement belongs to the same block. Similarly 1st,2nd,4th line belongs to the same block.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
A14. We can do this using print statement

Q14. What are operators in Python?
A14. Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values as per their use. We have different types of operators like arthimetic operator, logical operator.
     *,+,-,/,%,** these are some of the arthemtic operator which can be used for multiplication,addition, subtraction etc.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
A15. /- is used for simple division also known as float division. // - is used for integer divison, it will always give integer value as result.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
A16. var = 'iNeuron'
     print(var*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
A17. num = int(input('Please enter a number:'))
     if num%2 == 0
	print('You entered an even number')
     else :
	print('You entered an odd number')

Q18. What are boolean operator?
A18. Boolean operator return value as True or False after comparing the expression. e.g. 2>5 will be return as False and here operator is >

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 -> 1

0 and 0 -> 0

True and False and True -> False

1 or 0 or 0 -> 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
A20. If, else, elif are conditional statement in python.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
A22. age = int(input("Please enter your age:")
     if age >= 18:
	print("I can vote")
     else:
	print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
A23.    result = 0
	numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
	for i in range(len(numebrs):
		if(numbers[i]%2==0):
			result += numbers[i]

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
A24.    num1, num2, num3 = int(input("Please enter three numbers:"))
	ans = 0
	if num1>num2:
		if num3>num1:
			ans = num3
		else:
			ans = num1
	else:
		if num3>num2:
			ans = num3
		else:
			ans = num2

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
